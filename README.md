# Distributed Queue in Rust

Just playing around with Rust and trying to better understand some of its features.

![Flow Chart of a Simple Distributed Queue](/assets/readme.png)

I'm trying to get more familiar with:


- Mutex
- VecDeque
- Implementing a Load Balancer
- Implementing Task Workers

Currently this is not a distributed queue, however I plan on working towards it incrementally.
